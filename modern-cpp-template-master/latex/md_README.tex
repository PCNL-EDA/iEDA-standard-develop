A quick C++ template for modern C\+Make projects, aimed to be an easy to use starting point.

This is my personal take on such a type of template, thus I might not use the best practices or you might disagree with how I do things. Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysubsection{Features}\label{md_README_autotoc_md24}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Modern {\bfseries{C\+Make}} configuration and project, which, to the best of my knowledge, uses the best practices,
\item An example of a {\bfseries{Clang-\/\+Format}} config, inspired from the base {\itshape Google} model, with minor tweaks. This is aimed only as a starting point, as coding style is a subjective matter, everyone is free to either delete it (for the {\itshape L\+L\+VM} default) or supply their own alternative,
\item {\bfseries{Static analyzers}} integration, with {\itshape Clang-\/\+Tidy} and {\itshape Cppcheck}, the former being the default option,
\item {\bfseries{Doxygen}} support, through the {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+O\+X\+Y\+G\+EN} option, which you can enable if you wish to use it,
\item {\bfseries{Unit testing}} support, through {\itshape Google\+Test} (with an option to enable {\itshape Google\+Mock}) or {\itshape Catch2},
\item {\bfseries{Code coverage}}, enabled by using the {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+D\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+V\+E\+R\+A\+GE} option, through {\itshape Codecov} CI integration,
\item {\bfseries{Package manager support}}, with {\itshape Conan} and {\itshape Vcpkg}, through their respective options
\item {\bfseries{CI workflows for Windows, Linux and Mac\+OS}} using {\itshape Git\+Hub Actions}, making use of the caching features, to ensure minimum run time,
\item $\ast$$\ast$.md templates$\ast$$\ast$ for\+: {\itshape R\+E\+A\+D\+ME}, {\itshape Contributing Guideliness}, {\itshape Issues} and {\itshape Pull Requests},
\item {\bfseries{Permissive license}} to allow you to integrate it as easily as possible. The template is licensed under the \href{https://unlicense.org/}{\texttt{ Unlicense}},
\item Options to build as a header-\/only library or executable, not just a static or shared library.
\item {\bfseries{Ccache}} integration, for speeding up rebuild times

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md26}{}\doxysubsubsection{Prerequisites}\label{md_README_autotoc_md26}
This project is meant to be only a template, thus versions of the software used can be change to better suit the needs of the developer(s). If you wish to use the template {\itshape as-\/is}, meaning using the versions recommended here, then you will need\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{C\+Make v3.\+15+}} -\/ found at \href{https://cmake.org/}{\texttt{ https\+://cmake.\+org/}}
\item {\bfseries{C++ Compiler}} -\/ needs to support at least the {\bfseries{C++17}} standard, i.\+e. {\itshape M\+S\+VC}, {\itshape G\+CC}, {\itshape Clang}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
{\itshape {\bfseries{Note\+:}}} {\itshape You also need to be able to provide {\itshape {\bfseries{C\+Make}}} a supported }\end{quote}

{\itshape }\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md27}{}\doxysubsubsection{Installing}\label{md_README_autotoc_md27}
{\itshape  It is fairly easy to install the project, all you need to do is clone if from \href{https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub}} or \href{https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template/generate}{\texttt{ generate a new repository from it}} (also on {\bfseries{Git\+Hub}}).}

{\itshape If you wish to clone the repository, rather than generate from it, you simply need to run\+:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-\/cpp-\/template/}
\end{DoxyCode}
}

{\itshape After finishing getting a copy of the project, with any of the methods above, create a new folder in the {\ttfamily include/} folder, with the name of your project. Edit {\ttfamily cmake/\+Sources\+And\+Headers.\+cmake} to add your files.}

{\itshape You will also need to rename the {\ttfamily cmake/\+Project\+Config.\+cmake.\+in} file to start with the {\itshape {\bfseries{exact name of your project}}}. Such as {\ttfamily cmake/\+My\+New\+Project\+Config.\+cmake.\+in}. You should also make the same changes in the Git\+Hub workflows provided, notably \href{.github/workflows/ubuntu.yml}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily .github/workflows/ubuntu.\+yml}}}, in which you should replace the C\+Make option {\ttfamily -\/D\+Project\+\_\+\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+D\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+V\+E\+R\+A\+GE=1} to {\ttfamily -\/D\+My\+New\+Project\+\_\+\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+D\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+V\+E\+R\+A\+GE=1}.}

{\itshape Finally, change {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Project\char`\"{}} from {\ttfamily C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt}, from}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{project(}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "Project"}
\DoxyCodeLine{  VERSION 0.1.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{  LANGUAGES CXX}
\DoxyCodeLine{)}
\end{DoxyCode}
}

{\itshape to the {\itshape {\bfseries{exact name of your project}}}, i.\+e. using the previous name it will become\+:}

\DoxyCodeLine{  MyNewProject}
\DoxyCodeLine{  VERSION 0.1.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{  LANGUAGES CXX}
\DoxyCodeLine{)}
\end{DoxyCode}
}

{\itshape To install an already built project, you need to run the {\ttfamily install} target with C\+Make. For example\+:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build build -\/-\/target install -\/-\/config Release}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# a more general syntax for that command is:}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build <build\_directory> -\/-\/target install -\/-\/config <desired\_config>}
\end{DoxyCode}
}

{\itshape }\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysubsection{Building the project}\label{md_README_autotoc_md28}
{\itshape  To build the project, all you need to do, {\itshape {\bfseries{after correctly \href{README.md\#Installing}{\texttt{ installing the project}}}}}, is run a similar {\bfseries{C\+Make}} routine to the the one below\+:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build/ \&\& cd build/}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake .. -\/DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=/absolute/path/to/custom/install/directory}

{\itshape More options that you can set for the project can be found in the \href{cmake/StandardSettings.cmake}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily cmake/\+Standard\+Settings.\+cmake} file}}. For certain options additional configuration may be needed in their respective {\ttfamily $\ast$.cmake} files (i.\+e. Conan needs the {\ttfamily C\+O\+N\+A\+N\+\_\+\+R\+E\+Q\+U\+I\+R\+ES} and might need the {\ttfamily C\+O\+N\+A\+N\+\_\+\+O\+P\+T\+I\+O\+NS} to be setup for it work correctly; the two are set in the \href{cmake/Conan.cmake}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily cmake/\+Conan.\+cmake} file}}).}

{\itshape }\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysubsection{Generating the documentation}\label{md_README_autotoc_md29}
{\itshape  In order to generate documentation for the project, you need to configure the build to use Doxygen. This is easily done, by modifying the workflow shown above as follows\+:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build/ \&\& cd build/}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake .. -\/D<project\_name>\_ENABLE\_DOXYGEN=1 -\/DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=/absolute/path/to/custom/install/directory}

{\itshape  By default, the template uses \href{https://github.com/google/googletest/}{\texttt{ Google Test}} for unit testing. Unit testing can be disabled in the options, by setting the {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+U\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+T\+E\+S\+T\+I\+NG} (from \href{cmake/StandardSettings.cmake}{\texttt{ cmake/\+Standard\+Settings.\+cmake}}) to be false. To run the tests, simply use C\+Test, from the build directory, passing the desire configuration for which to run tests for. An example of this procedure is\+:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build          \# if not in the build directory already}
\DoxyCodeLine{ctest -\/C Release  \# or `ctest -\/C Debug` or any other configuration you wish to test}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
