**Assignment1**  
This repository will contain the implementation of Assigment1.  
  
This project use **Hierholzer algorithm** to find an Euler Circuit  
  
***We offer several quick command to build, debug and run this project in Makefile***  
We can just type   
**make run**  
And get the result of the Euler Circuit.  
  
<!--   
The line below we should have GoogleTest  
You can   
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git  
if you do not have that package    
Here we already offer it    
 -->  
  
After we build the project, we alse can use ***google test*** to check the answer  
We can   
**make build**  
**./build/test/EulerTest**  
Then get the result of google test.
